			<H1>Hello, I'm Arthur 👋</H1>
			<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Arthur Gard" class="img-circle">
			<p> I'm a French student currently living in Paris but that loves surfing anyway. I am fond of Marketing strategy, branding and I am very interested in environmental issues. </p>

			<H2>Marketing 📝</H2>
			<p>I discovered Marketing during my first year of studies and it quickly became one of my biggest center of interest so that, since my third year spent in exchange in India, my studies have been specialised in Marketing !</p>

			<H2>Surfing 🏄‍♂️</H2>
			<p>I discovered water sports when I was four, while living in Lisbon. Since then, I created a very strong link with the ocean, especially through my passion : surfing !</p>

			<H2>Environment 🌍</H2>
			<p>I have been surfing for years now, and this passion led me to create a real connexion with nature so that I became really aware of environmental issues. Hence, I decided to write my thesis about CSR initiatives, more specifically studying their impact on a company's brand image and attractiveness for candidates - always a link with Marketing and branding !</p>
